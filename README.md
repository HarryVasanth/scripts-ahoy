# üóûÔ∏è scripts-ahoy

### Welcome to my repository of useful Linux/Unix scripts!

Here you will find a collection of scripts that I have found helpful in my day-to-day use of the command line. These scripts can help automate tasks, perform system maintenance, and more.

Please note that some of these scripts may require additional dependencies or packages to be installed on your system. These dependencies will be noted in the header of the script, and it is your responsibility to ensure that they are installed before running the script.

I hope these scripts are as helpful to you as they have been to me!

## Git

### [Pull script](git/pull.sh)

Local update multiple repositories from list. List example is [here](bash/list_example.txt).

#### Usage:

```bash
bash git/pull.sh bash/list_example.txt
```

### [Push script](git/push.sh)

Script for pushing git repository to all it's remotes. If it's called without arguments it pushes current folder. Else it parses filelist like pull script. List example is [here](bash/list_example.txt).

#### Usage:

```bash
bash git/push.sh bash/list_example.txt
# or
bash git/push.sh
```

### [Change author](git/change_author.sh)

Change the author and committer name and e-mail of multiple commits for all branches and tags (original here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/750182). You should run this script from folder with repository to change.

**WARNING! These changes are dangerous because they change remote git history!**

#### Usage:

```bash
# Run this script from folder with repository to change.
bash git/change_author.sh WRONG_EMAIL CORRECT_NAME CORRECT_EMAIL
```

## Bash

### [Tar ssh](bash/ssh_tar.sh)

Copy folder via ssh using tar to current folder. It can be useful for copying folder with large amount of files via ssh. It's faster than pure ssh.

#### Usage:

```bash
bash bash/ssh_tar.sh user@host /path/to/folder
# or
bash bash/ssh_tar.sh user@host -p port /path/to/folder
```

### [Parse filelist](bash/parse_filelist.sh)

Parse filelist, call command \$2 for each folder from filelist \$1 and print text \$3 for each folder. List example is [here](bash/list_example.txt).

#### Usage:

```bash
# to show all directories in file bash/list_example.txt
bash/parse_filelist.sh bash/list_example.txt pwd "Current directory"
```

### [Count words](bash/wc.sh)

Call word count util (wc) for files in directory \$1 with extensions \$2, \$3, \$n etc.

#### Usage:

```bash
# For example to call wc for C and C++ files and headers (files *.c, *.cpp, *.cxx, *.h, *.hpp, *.hxx) run:
bash/wc.sh . c cpp cxx h hpp hxx
```

## Proxmox

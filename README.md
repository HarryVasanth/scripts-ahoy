# üóûÔ∏è scripts-ahoy

### Welcome to my repository of useful Linux/Unix scripts!

Here you will find a collection of scripts that I have found helpful in my day-to-day use of the command line. These scripts can help automate tasks, perform system maintenance, and more. To use a script, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired script. Then, make the script executable using the `chmod +x` command and run it using `./<scriptname>.<ext>`.

Please note that some of these scripts may require additional dependencies or packages to be installed on your system. These dependencies will be noted in the header of the script, and it is your responsibility to ensure that they are installed before running the script.

I hope these scripts are as helpful to you as they have been to me!
